# Minimal APIs | Help Wanted! ðŸš€

## Project Overview
This is a planned project to demonstrate and implement [Minimal APIs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/minimal-apis?view=aspnetcore-9.0) in [ASP.NET Core](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/introduction-to-aspnet-core?view=aspnetcore-9.0). We're looking for passionate developers to help bring this project to life!

## What are Minimal APIs?
[Minimal APIs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/minimal-apis?view=aspnetcore-9.0) are a lightweight but powerful way to build APIs with ASP.NET Core. They're designed to be simple and efficient, requiring minimal code and ceremony while maintaining high performance. Perfect for microservices and small to medium-sized applications.

## Help Wanted!
We're seeking contributors who:
- Have experience with [C#](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/) and [ASP.NET Core](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/introduction-to-aspnet-core?view=aspnetcore-9.0)
- Are interested in modern development patterns
- Want to learn or already know [Minimal APIs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/minimal-apis?view=aspnetcore-9.0)
- Can help create clear documentation and examples

## Project Goals
1. Create a comprehensive example application using [DataStar](https://github.com/starfederation/datastar) and Minimal APIs
2. Demonstrate best practices and common patterns
3. Provide clear documentation for newcomers
4. Show integration with common tools and libraries

## Getting Started
This project is currently in the planning phase. If you're interested in contributing:
1. Follow the patterns from the existing Mvc project
2. Leave a comment expressing your interest
3. Share your experience level with [ASP.NET Core](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/introduction-to-aspnet-core?view=aspnetcore-9.0) and Minimal APIs
4. Indicate what aspects you'd like to work on

## Contact
