# Datastar SDK testing suite

This test suite uses curl(1), cat(1) and sh(1) to test that a server respects the SDK spec found in `../README.md`.

It expects a server to expose a `/test` endpoint that accepts all HTTP methods. The server should then use ReadSignals
to extract the `events` array. It must then loop through the array of events and use `event.type` to decide which server sent event to use. If the output of the server differs from the expected output, then an error will be printed to the terminal.

## Usage

```
$ ./test-all.sh $server_address
Running tests with argument: $server_address
Processing GET cases...
Processing POST cases...
```

 If nothing else is outputted then all tests passed !

 Results of the test can be found in `./get_cases/$case_name/testOutput.txt` (or `post_cases` depending on the test).

 Take note that these tests are stricter about data line ordering then the SDK spec is, but unless that becomes an actual problem I dont intend to fix it, since it would add complexity.

 ## Adding new cases

 To add a new test case, simply add a folder named after the test in either `./get-cases` or `./post-cases`.

That folder must contain an `input.json` file and an `output.txt` file.

The `input.json` file must contain valid json of the following shape:
```
{"events":
  [
    { "type": "executeScript",
      "script": "console.log('hello');",
      "eventId": 1,
      "retryDuration": 2000,
       "attributes": {
         "type": "text/javascript",
         "blocking": false
       },
       "autoRemove": false
     }
   ]
}
```

The `output.txt` file must contain valid a `txt/eventstream` like such:

```
event: datastar-execute-script
id: 1
retry: 2000
data: attributes type text/javascript
data: attributes blocking false
data: autoRemove false
data: script console.log('hello');


```
