        <br/>after that we will sleep for 70 seconds, during which time
        <br/>the pings will continue so we don't time out. Then we will again
        <br/>replace the div with the current time 10 times. After that this
        <br/>text will be removed with a RemoveFragments command
        <br/>after a "settleDuration" of 5 seconds

        When you click the John Keats button, his beautiful
        <i>Ode to a Nightingale</i>
        <br/>Will be slowly printed below, as if someone were typing it
        <br/>on a keyboard.
