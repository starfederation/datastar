# WIP Release Notes

## v1.0.0-beta.9

### Fixed

- Fixed a bug in which `data-signals` was being reapplied each time any attribute changed on an element ([#709](https://github.com/starfederation/datastar/issues/709)).
- Fixed a bug in which focus was not being restored to input elements after merging fragments ([#710](https://github.com/starfederation/datastar/issues/710)).
- Fixed a bug in which signals bound to text input elements with a `value` attribute were being reset to the value when the entered value was empty.
