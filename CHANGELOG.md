# WIP Release Notes

## v1.0.0-beta.10

### Added

- Added a `retries-failed` event type that is dispatched when the SSE plugin fails after retrying ([#785](https://github.com/starfederation/datastar/issues/785)).

### Changed

- Updated Idiomorph to version [0.7.3](https://github.com/bigskysoftware/idiomorph/releases/tag/v0.7.3).
- Renamed the `data-intersects` attribute to `data-on-intersect`.
- Renamed the `data-on-signals-change` attribute to `data-on-signal-change`.
- Classes used in `data-class-*` attributes now default to kebab-case ([#761](https://github.com/starfederation/datastar/issues/761)).
- Events used in `data-on-*` attributes now default to kebab-case ([#761](https://github.com/starfederation/datastar/issues/761)).
- The `datastar-sse` event is now dispatched on the element itself ([#761](https://github.com/starfederation/datastar/issues/761)).
- The NPM package now also exports all plugins and bundles ([#742](https://github.com/starfederation/datastar/issues/742)).
- Data attributes with plugin names in their prefix are no longer processed ([#771](https://github.com/starfederation/datastar/issues/771)).
- The alias used in the aliased bundle has been renamed to `star` (`data-star-*`) ([#772](https://github.com/starfederation/datastar/issues/772)).

### Fixed

- Fixed the applying of plugins to give custom plugins a chance to load ([#740](https://github.com/starfederation/datastar/issues/740)).
- Fixed a bug in which the indicator signal was not being reset when the element it was on was removed from the DOM ([#749](https://github.com/starfederation/datastar/issues/749)).
- Fixed a bug in which merging multiple targets was not working correctly ([#780](https://github.com/starfederation/datastar/issues/780)).

### Removed

- Removed the ability to use a key with the `data-persist` attribute.
- Removed settling from SSE events, which has become redundant ([#764](https://github.com/starfederation/datastar/issues/764)).
